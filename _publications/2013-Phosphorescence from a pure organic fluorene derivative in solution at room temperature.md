A fluorene derivative having both bromo and formyl groups exhibited bright phosphorescence emission in common organic solvents at room temperature. The absolute phosphorescence quantum yield reached 5.9% in chloroform at 298 K. When the fluorene derivative was incorporated into a poly(methyl methacrylate) film, the phosphorescence emission was similarly observed even under air at room temperature for over five days.
